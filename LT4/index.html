                <p>I'm always skeptical about how most people are amazed with the stars yet no one has ever been close to one.<br><br>
                    I'm always skeptical about how most people are amazed with the oceans yet they haven't even wander on their depths.<br><br>
                    I'm always skeptical about how most people are amazed with deities yet they can't prove either way of their existence.<br><br>
                    Perhaps we are just completely fascinated by the unknown. <br><br>
                    We are just so fascinated with the idea of unfolding the mysteries, not the mystery itself and if we were able to decipher the stars, oceans and deities somewhere in the future...<br><br>
                    Will you still love the idea of them?<br><br>
